# ColorHelper 2.0.0

## New

- Show inline color previews in Sublime Text 3118+!  See docs for more info.  Can be turned off if the feature is not desired.
- Should update mdpopups to the latest one on Package Control upgrade (restart required after upgrade).
- Images should scale with font size in Sublime Text 3118+.  You can still select small, medium, and large resources, but they will be relative to the font size now.
